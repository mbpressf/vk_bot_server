# VK astrology bot:
 
Hi! This project is a unique order I completed on a freelance platform.

My task was to enrich the customer's astrological community in the VK social network. The customer provided 12 examples of filters, which needed to be converted into code to be able to apply these filters to any photos.

To realise the project, a bot was created in VK using the vkbottle library. I developed an efficient funnel that ensures that the user has access to the functionality of sending photos in any situation. Photos are uploaded via a GET request with a direct link to the image, complementing the functionality of vkbottle.

Next, I developed 12 photo processing functions representing a variety of filters. Each time a user submits a photo, one of the functions is randomly selected and its filter is applied to the image. The customer's wish to change the text for the images was also taken into account. I created a folder with different texts, which are then combined and sent to the bot, which sends the photo with the filter applied.

The customer was completely **satisfied with the result of the work**, noting the high quality and completion of the project in the shortest possible time. My efforts are aimed at taking into account all the client's wishes, which emphasises my professionalism and attitude to project execution.
